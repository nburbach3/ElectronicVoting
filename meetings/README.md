#   Agendas and Minutes

This directory contains three agendas.

-   `agenda-20200413.md` is a notional agenda for your combined kickoff meeting
    and sprint 1 planning meeting
-   `agenda-20200422.md` is a notional agenda for your combined sprint 1 review/
    retrospective and sprint 2 planning meeting
-   `agenda-scrum-meeting.md` is a notional agenda for your "daily" scrum
    meetings on the other class days

You may modify these agendas to suit your needs. Use the agendas to form the
outlines of the minutes for your meetings, which you should place in this
directory.

At the start of each meeting, copy the appropriate agenda to a file named
`minutes-yyyymmdd.md` where *yyyy* is the year, *mm* is the two-digit month,
and *dd* is the two-digit day of the month. For example, the minutes from the
combined kickoff & sprint 1 planning meeting would be named
`minutes-20200413.md`. Your notetaker for that meeting should edit the minutes
file (*not* the agenda file) to make a record of the meeting and then push the
minutes to the repository when they are finished.

The minutes for each meeting are due at 11:59pm CDT (UTC-5) on the day of the
that meeting.
