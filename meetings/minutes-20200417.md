Meeting Minutes
Test Driven Development

Once current issues assigned for Wednesday, April 22 are completed and basic functionality established, begin the creation of JUnit Tests.

JUnit Tests will be designed to find bugs in the software before the software is complete.

Possible tests include:
* Testing to see if Voter table is cleared of pertinent information upon creation of new election
* Testing to see if Candidate table is cleared of information upon creation of new election
* Testing to see if vote count increases by one when a vote is cast
* Testing to see if proper error message appears when an invalid third-party search is performed
* Testing to see if proper information is returned when a valid third-party search is performed
* Testing to see if proper message is returned when voter authentication is negative
